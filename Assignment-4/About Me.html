        <b>Who am I?</b>
        <br>
        This simple sentence with three words is one which we have all encountered at least 
        once in our lives. Whether it was a question someone else prompted you to answer, or 
        a question that arose from your curiosuty and you had to answer it yourself. This 
        seemingly simple question calls for deep self-reflection. For a long time, I found 
        this question disturbing since unlike others, I did not have a concrete answer. I was 
        who I was, and I am who I am- that's what I thought the answer was for me. However, it
        is not. This question cannot be answered in a singular statement, it has many layers and 
        dimensions to it. One of the dimensions happen to be one's skills and interests.

        me and who I am. My interests include:
